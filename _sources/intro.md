## Quantum subset-sum

Here we solve a specific instance of the quantum subset sum problem, described below. This was my submission for the QOSF Mentorship Cohort 5. The decision version of this (deciding whether there is a subset that adds to a certain value) [is known to be NP-Hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem?oldformat=true) in many cases.
